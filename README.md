# IG-CLONE in React

This is our React Version of the IG-CLONE application.

The main branch has everything we did on Thursday but the <a href="https://github.com/bocacode/ig-clone-react/tree/with-likes">with-likes</a> branch has likes button and everything is moved correctly to a service (so that you can point it from localhost to what ever endpoint you need.)
